### 1. Do the hands-on practice
Finish the two hands-on practice from [CDN.md](CDN.md) and [DNS.md](DNS.md)

### 2. Draw a infrastructure architecture diagram
Draw a infrastructure architecture diagram for the hands-on that you just did for CDN and DNS. It should include 3 components:
1. the jiangren.com.au website
2. the CloudFront CDN component
3. the Route53 hosted zone

Please reflect following in the diagram:
1. the relationship between above components
2. the traffic flow when a user requests your "your_name.jiangrendevops.com" website. i.e. what happens after a user type in "your_name.jiangrendevops.com" website in a browser?

You can use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to draw this diagram easily. Make sure you save both XML file(.drawio) and the diagram picture file (.png) when you finish, so that you can edit your diagram again in the future.
