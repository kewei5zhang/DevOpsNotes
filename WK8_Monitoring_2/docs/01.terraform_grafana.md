# Managing Grafana Dashboard with Terraform

## Goal
* Use Grafana to manage a team's dashboards

## Steps
### 1. Spin up your grafana server locally
```
cd code
docker build -t jr/flask_app_statsd .
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-infra.yml up
```
If you have trouble to spin it up, please follow the last week lecture notes to clean up your environment first.

### 2. Let us prepare a main.tf and variables.tf file
```
cd ..
mkdir terraform_grafana
cd terraform_grafana
touch provider.tf
touch main.tf
touch variables.tf
```
Your folder structure should now look like:
```
WK8_Monitoring_2
|_docs
|_...
|_terraform_grafana
    |_main.tf
    |_provider.tf
    |_variables.tf
```

### 3. Find the provider
go to https://registry.terraform.io/ and search for grafana
![Alt text](../images/registry.png?raw=true)

click on the "🤝Partner grafana/grafana"

### 4. Click on "USE PROVIDER" and Copy the content to provider.tf
![Alt text](../images/use_provider.png?raw=true)


### 5. Fill in the options so that you can connect to grafana
Checkout https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs for the example usage

Fill in the main.tf as follows:
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    grafana = {
      source  = "grafana/grafana"
      version = "1.14.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "grafana" {
  url  = "http://localhost:3000"
  auth = var.grafana_auth
}
```

Fill in the variables.tf as follows:
```
variable "grafana_auth" {
	description = "Grafana auth"
  type    = string
	sensitive = true
}
```
We are going to use environment variables to pass in sensitve credentials

### 6. Let us do some formatting and validating
```
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
```

You should see
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

### 7. Check what you can do with the grafana provider
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs/resources/dashboard

### 8. Share your already created dashboard as Json
Load grafana on http://localhost:3000
Open Mannual -> Dashboards -> Your recently created dashboard -> Share Dashboard -> Export -> View JSON -> Copy to Clipboard
![Alt text](../images/share_dashboard.png?raw=true)
Export -> Save to file

```
touch my_dashboard.json
```

And past the dashboard json to the file

Now move it under `terraform_grafana/`
```
mv ~/Downloads/<your dashboard.json> .
```

Once you finish creating your dashboard and panels, export it out as a json file

### 9. Add the dashboard to your terraform config
In main.tf add the following:
```
resource "grafana_folder" "terraform" {
  title = "Managed by Terraform"
}

resource "grafana_dashboard" "terraform" {
  folder      = grafana_folder.terraform.uid
  config_json = file("my_dashboard.json")
}
```
What is the meaning of the config `overwrite`?

### 10. Try apply
```
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform apply
```

You will see the dashboard you created got moved into a folder name "Managed by Terraform"

Try to `terraform destroy` the current one and redo the `terraform apply`.

Now, no matter what others may change your dashboard, you can simply recover it by `terraform apply`


### Homework
Are you able to config the data_source and the alert?
