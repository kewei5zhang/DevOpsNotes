# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

## TLDR;

## Run a workflow on any GitHub event

Kick off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built and maintained by the community.

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projects—there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.

## Features

### Environment

**Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers:** Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.

**Matrix builds:** Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.

**Any language:** GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.

**Live logs:** See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.

**Built in secret store:** Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.

**Multi-container testing:** Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some docker-compose to your workflow file.

**Community-powered workflows:** GitHub Actions connects all of your tools to automate every step of your development workflow. Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.

Want to venture off the beaten path? Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.
