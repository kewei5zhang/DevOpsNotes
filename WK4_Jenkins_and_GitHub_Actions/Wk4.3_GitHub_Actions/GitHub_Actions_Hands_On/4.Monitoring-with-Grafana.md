# Monitoring with Grafana

Source: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/

## What is Grafana?

Grafana website: https://grafana.com/grafana/

Grafana is an open-source data visualization and monitoring platform. It allows users to query, visualize, and alert on metrics and logs from various data sources such as Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and many others. Grafana provides a web-based interface for creating and sharing dashboards, which can be used to display real-time data, such as server and application performance metrics, and to alert on certain conditions. It is commonly used for DevOps and IoT applications, and its plugins and integrations allow it to fit into a variety of workflows.

## Observability

**Observability** is a term used in the context of monitoring systems to describe the degree to which a system's internal state can be inferred from its external outputs. In other words, it refers to the extent to which the behavior and performance of a system can be observed and analyzed. In the context of IT infrastructure and applications, observability includes the ability to collect and analyze data from various sources, such as logs, metrics, and traces, to gain insight into the state of the system. This data can then be used to identify performance issues, isolate root causes of failures, and make data-driven decisions to improve the overall health and stability of the system.

Examples of metrics and measures in the context of monitoring systems include:

- Resource utilization: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space utilization, network bandwidth usage, etc.

- Application performance: Request latency, error rates, number of requests per second, response time, etc.

- Infrastructure performance: Server uptime, network latency, disk I/O operations per second, etc.

- Business metrics: Revenue, customer satisfaction, conversion rate, etc.

- Log data: System logs, application logs, security logs, etc.

- Tracing data: Request tracing, error tracing, distributed tracing, etc.

These metrics and measures can be collected and analyzed in real-time to monitor the performance and behavior of a system, detect issues and anomalies, and make data-driven decisions for improvement.

## Install Grafana on Ubuntu

To install the latest release:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
sudo wget -q -O /usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key
```

Add this repository for stable releases:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

After you add the repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest OSS release:
sudo apt-get install grafana
```

## Sign in to Grafana

Steps

1. To sign in to Grafana for the first time, follow these steps:

2. Open your web browser and go to <http://grafana-ip:3000/>. Unless you have configured a different port, Grafana listens to port 3000 by default.

3. On the signin page, enter admin for username and password.

4. Click Sign in. If successful, you will see a prompt to change the password.

5. Click OK on the prompt and change your password.

## Connect to Azure Monitor

Reference Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin

1. Create a Service Principle for Grafana instance from Azure Cloud CLI

    ```PowerShell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <sp-name> --role "Monitoring Reader" --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>   
    ```

    You will get a response like below.

    ```json
    {
        "appId": "8e897eb4-069d-40c2-9563-000000003c14",
        "displayName": "<AppName>",
        "password": "xxxxxvJgeKZoRAfxxxx0SitnANH8Kxxxx",
        "tenant": "000088bf-0000-0000-0000-2d7cd0100000"
    }
    ```

    Copy all values, they will be used later.

    > Note: for more details about creating an Azure service principal, please refer to [Create an Azure service principal with Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

2. Add Azure Monitor plugin

## Azure Managed Grafana

Azure Managed Grafana is a data visualization platform built on top of the Grafana software by Grafana Labs. It's built as a fully managed Azure service operated and supported by Microsoft.

Source: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/managed-grafana/>

### Why use Azure Managed Grafana?

Managed Grafana lets you bring together all your telemetry data into one place. It can access a wide variety of data sources supported, including your data stores in Azure and elsewhere. By combining charts, logs and alerts into one view, you can get a holistic view of your application and infrastructure, and correlate information across multiple datasets.

As a fully managed service, Azure Managed Grafana lets you deploy Grafana without having to deal with setup. The service provides high availability, SLA guarantees and automatic software updates.

You can share Grafana dashboards with people inside and outside of your organization and allow others to join in for monitoring or troubleshooting.

Managed Grafana uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)â€™s centralized identity management, which allows you to control which users can use a Grafana instance, and you can use managed identities to access Azure data stores, such as Azure Monitor.

You can create dashboards instantaneously by importing existing charts directly from the Azure portal or by using prebuilt dashboards.
