# Group Activity Git Practice

Team up with others 2 to 3 people together, and pick a team leader

## Team leader

1. Create a public GitHub repository with a README file
2. Invite your teammates to this repository. See <https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository>
3. Make sure the configuration does not allow changes push to master branch directly. See <https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule>
4. Make sure the team members have the right level access (read and write).

## Team members

1. Clone/pull the repository that your team leader created.
2. Create your own feature branch from the master branch. e.g. name your branch as "feature/holly".
3. Change the content in first line of the README file to your name. Commit and push the change.
4. Raise a pull request from your feature branch to master branch. Let other team members (including team leader) review the pull request, then merge the pull request.

## Intermediate Practice - fix pull request conflict

1. Have two team member do "Team members" section step 1-3.
2. Let team member 1 merge his/her pull request to main branch.
3. Let team member 2 raise his/her pull request.
4. Do you see any conflicts? How would you fix it?
