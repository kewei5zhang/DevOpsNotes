# Build Dashboard
## Error Rate & Throughput
Error Rate
```
sum(rate(request_count_total{client="statsd",endpoint="/simulation",status="500"}[10m]))/sum(rate(request_count_total{client="statsd",endpoint="/simulation"}[10m]))
```
Total Throughput
```
sum(rate(request_count_total{client="statsd", endpoint="/simulation"}[10m]))
```
Throughput by API
```
sum by (endpoint) (rate(request_count[15s]))
```

## Request Duration
Average Request Duration
```
avg(rate(request_latency_seconds_sum{endpoint="/simulation"}[1m])/rate(request_latency_seconds_count{endpoint="/simulation"}[1m]))
```
use the percentile in three separate queries
```
avg by (quantile) (request_latency_seconds_hist{client="statsd",endpoint="/simulation"})
```

## Availability
Availability of your check

You will need to add a `/healthcheck` endpoint in your application and monitor the `/healthcheck` status via the
load balancer.  

## Saturation
### CPU
This is a counter
```
avg by (job) (irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[1m]))
```

### Memory
This is a gauge
```
avg by (job) (process_resident_memory_bytes / 1000/1000)
```
### Disk
Leave it as a homework

## Export and redo the terraform step
You now should have a beautiful dashboard like this:

Understand sum(rate)
Update dash and notes
